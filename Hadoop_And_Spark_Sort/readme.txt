Hadoop Sort Script:

1. This script has to be run from the hadoop cluster machine.
2. Following conditions have to be satisfied before running this script:
    a. The hadoop is installed in /exports/projects/hadoop-3.2.1/
    b. There is a hadoop file system and there is /home/input directory in hadoop file system that has the file generated by gensort
    c. There is no /home/output directory in hadoop file system before running this script. Because this is where script writes
        out files.
    d. All the environment variables like JAVA_HOME, HADOOP_PREFIX are set
    e. HadoopSort.java is in /exports/projects/hadoop-3.2.1/
3. Now you can run the hadoopscript.sh executable which builds HadoopSort.java and then runs the jar file and outputs files to 
    hdfs's /home/output directory
    
    
Spark Sort Script:
1. This script has to be run from the spark cluster machine.
2. Following conditions have to be satisfied before running this script:
    a. The hadoop is installed in /exports/projects/hadoop-3.2.1/
    b. The spark is installed in /exports/projects/spark-3.0.0-preview2-bin-hadoop3.2.1/
    c. There is a hadoop file system and there is /home/input directory in hadoop file system that has the file generated by gensort
    d. There is no /home/output directory in hadoop file system before running this script. Because this is where script writes
        out files.
    e. All the environment variables like JAVA_HOME, HADOOP_PREFIX, SPARK_HOME are set
    f. SparkSort.java is in /exports/projects/spark-3.0.0-preview2-bin-hadoop3.2.1/
3. Now you can run the sparkscript.sh executable which builds SparkSort.java and then runs the jar file and outputs files to 
    hdfs's /home/output directory
